Peer Assessment Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This project includes a script called run_analysis.R which will downloads and extracts the required data set into a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" in the current directory. Running the run_analysis.R will create an output text file named tidy_data.txt in the current working directory.

The cookbook.md in this depository has additional details about the script.
