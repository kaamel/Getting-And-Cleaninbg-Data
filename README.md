Peer Assessment Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This project includes a script called run_analysis.R which will downloads and extracts the required data set into a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" in the current directory. It will then create a tidy data file an output a text file named tidy_data.txt in the current working directory.

###Important: if there is an unrelated directory in the working directory named "UCI HAR Dataset", it is important to change the working directory or move the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory somewhere else, otherwise this script will might not work correctly.

The Codebook.md in this depository has additional details about the script.
